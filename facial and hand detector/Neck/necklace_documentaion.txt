Objective:- To find points on neck and resize the necklace to place on the neck.

Procedure:-
1. We imported opencv, face_recognition of dlib, PIL and numpy.
2. We found facial landmarks using face recognition and also found the chin location.
3. Jewelry width & height calculated using face chin coordinates.
4. We add both images so that the black region in any image will result in another image non black regions being rendered over that area.
5. And finally we replace jewel area with newly created jewel_area.
